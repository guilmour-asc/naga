This was my **course conclusion project** for the _bachelor_ title in Computer Science, on the **Federal Institute of Minas Gerais' South - Muzambinho Campus**, or more recognizably the [IF Sul de Minas](https://www.muz.ifsuldeminas.edu.br/).
The code gives option to use either **OpenCV** or **Dlib** for generating face-detected results of given samples (images or videos). For proper use, I shall publish my paper somewhere on the webz (futurely).
